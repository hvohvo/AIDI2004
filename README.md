imports the essential libraries, including scikit-learn's various modules, pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib.pyplot.
'df' is a pandas DataFrame that is loaded with the breast cancer dataset from the specified URL.
removes the columns "id" and "Unnamed: 32" from the DataFrame.

converts the "diagnosis" column's values ("M" and "B") to the corresponding binary values (1 and 0).
checks the DataFrame for any missing values.
uses a count plot to depict the distribution of diagnoses.
examines the connections between the features in the dataset by creating a correlation matrix heatmap.
divides the data into training and testing sets to prepare it for training.
utilises the StandardScaler to scale the features.
creates an SVM classifier from scratch and fits it to the training set of data.
uses the trained SVM classifier to make predictions about the test data.
calculates the classifier's accuracy using the test data.
creates a confusion matrix to assess the classifier's performance.
Overall, the algorithm preprocesses data, analyses exploratory data, and trains an SVM classifier to predict the diagnosis of breast cancer based on the attributes supplied. Approximately 98.25% accuracy was attained by the classifier on the test set.
